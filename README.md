# Fake SQS [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/iain/fake_sqs.png)](http://travis-ci.org/iain/fake_sqs)

Inspired by [Fake DynamoDB] [fake_dynamo], this is an AWS SQS compatible
message queue that can be ran locally. This makes it ideal for integration
testing, just like you would have a local database running. Fake SQS doesn't
persist anything, not even the queues themselves. You'll have to create the
queues everytime you start it.

This implementation is **not complete** yet, but should be useful already.

Done so far are:

* Creating queues
* Deleting queues
* Listing queues (with prefixes)
* Get queue url via the name
* Send messages (and in batch)
* Receive messages (and in batch)
* Deleting messages (and in batch)
* Changing queue attributes (but not all, and no validation)
* Setting visibility timeouts for messages
* Purge Queue

Certain bits are left off on purpose, to make it easier to work with, such as:

* No checking on access keys or signatures
* No 60 second delay between deleting a queue and recreating it.

Other parts are just not done yet:

* Permissions
* Error handling

So, actually, just the basics are implemented at this point.

PS. There is also [Fake SNS] [fake_sns].

## Usage

To install:

```
$ gem install fake_sqs
```

To start:

```
$ fake_sqs
```

To configure, see the options in the help:

```
$ fake_sqs --help
```

By default, FakeSQS uses an in-memory database (just a hash actually). To make
it persistant, run with:

```
$ fake_sqs --database /path/to/database.yml
```

Messages are not persisted, just the queues.

This is an example of how to configure some of the official SDKs to let them talk to Fake SQS.

### [Ruby] [aws-sdk-for-ruby]

``` ruby
AWS.config(
  :use_ssl           => false,
  :sqs_endpoint      => "localhost",
  :sqs_port          => 4568,
  :access_key_id     => "access key id",
  :secret_access_key => "secret access key"
)
```

### [Javascript] [aws-sdk-js]

```javascript
var aws = require('aws-sdk');
var sqs = new aws.SQS({
  endpoint: 'http://localhost:4568',
  apiVersion: '2012-11-05',
  accessKeyId: 'access key id',
  secretAccessKey: 'secret access key',
  region: 'region'
});
```

### [PHP] [aws-sdk-php]

```php
$client = new Aws\Sqs\SqsClient([
  'version'     => 'latest',
  'endpoint'    => 'http://localhost:4568',
  'credentials' => [
    'key'    => 'access key id',
    'secret' => 'secret access key'
  ]
]);
```

If you have the configuration options for other libraries, please give them to
me.

To reset the entire server, during tests for example, send a DELETE request to
the server. For example:

```
$ curl -X DELETE http://localhost:4568/
```

Within SQS, after receiving, messages will be available again automatically
after a certain time. While this is not implemented (for now at least), you can
trigger this behavior at at will, with a PUT request.

```
$ curl -X PUT http://localhost:4568/
```


### Test Integration

When making integration tests for your app, you can easily include Fake SQS.

Here are the methods you need to run FakeSQS programmatically.

``` ruby
require "fake_sqs/test_integration"

# globally, before the test suite starts:
AWS.config(
  use_ssl:            false,
  sqs_endpoint:       "localhost",
  sqs_port:           4568,
  access_key_id:      "fake access key",
  secret_access_key:  "fake secret key",
)
fake_sqs = FakeSQS::TestIntegration.new

# before each test that requires SQS:
fake_sqs.start

# at the end of the suite:
at_exit {
  fake_sqs.stop
}
```

By starting it like this it will start when needed, and reset between each test.

Here's an example for RSpec to put in `spec/spec_helper.rb`:

``` ruby
AWS.config(
  use_ssl:            false,
  sqs_endpoint:       "localhost",
  sqs_port:           4568,
  access_key_id:      "fake access key",
  secret_access_key:  "fake secret key",
)

RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.treat_symbols_as_metadata_keys_with_true_values = true
  config.before(:suite) { $fake_sqs = FakeSQS::TestIntegration.new }
  config.before(:each, :sqs) { $fake_sqs.start }
  config.after(:suite) { $fake_sqs.stop }
end
```

Now you can use the `:sqs metadata to enable SQS integration:

``` ruby
describe "something with sqs", :sqs do
  it "should work" do
    queue = AWS::SQS.new.queues.create("my-queue")
  end
end
```

## Development

Run all the specs:

```
$ rake
```

This will run the unit tests, then the acceptance tests for both types of
storage (in-memory and on disk).

When debugging an acceptance test, you can run it like this, which will redirect
output to the console:

```
$ DEBUG=true SQS_DATABASE=tmp/sqs.yml rspec spec/acceptance
```
